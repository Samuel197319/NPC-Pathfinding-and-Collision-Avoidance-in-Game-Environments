# NPC Pathfinding and Collision Avoidance in Game Environments

## Objective
To implement efficient movement algorithms and real-time collision detection for NPCs in game spaces.

## Simulation Type
Agent-Based Simulation

## Types of Dataset
1. Game maps
2. character positions
3. movement traces

## Possible Sources for Dataset
1. OpenAI Gym
2. Unity ML-Agents
3. GitHub

## Dataset URLs
1. https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents

## Setup Instructions
1. 1. Install NetLogo or Unity ML-Agents Toolkit.
2. 2. Design grid-based or 3D maps.
3. 3. Define NPC agents and goal points.

## Implementation Guide
1. 1. Implement A* or Dijkstra for movement towards goal.
2. 2. Simulate real-time obstacle appearance and NPC reaction.
3. 3. Add collision detection and rerouting logic.
4. 4. Track success rate and efficiency.

## Expected Output(s)
1. NPC movement animations
2. collision heatmaps
3. success rate graphs.
